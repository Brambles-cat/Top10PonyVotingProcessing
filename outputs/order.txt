Idk why i made this but my order of processing:
First pull is linksToTitles which saves into "processedfuzzlist.csv"
Then the duplicate check uses the original inputfile (datalinks.csv for me) and saves the changes into "processedduplicates.csv"
After that the blacklist check uses that duplicate output and saves the new made changes into "processedblacklist.csv"
Next up is the duration check which is the same thing uses previous output and saves changes into a final csv. (processed.csv)
Last thing is fuzzlist thing which checks processedfuzzlist for similar cells and saves it to final output.


This is stupid so a cool To-Do for anyone reading this mess:
Make it better :P
